# VideoFunk

## Introduction 
Here's a little application I wrote, for creating a video showing list of names, one at a time.

## Getting Started
1. See if it can build in Visual Studio
2. add names in .\Data\names.txt
3. Start the script/console
4. Open the generated file (currently in 'd:\temp\myfilename.wlmp') in Movie Maker

## Roadmap
Nah. When I have time or another idea pops up I will modify this project.
Movie Maker is outdated, so I assume the first thing is to see if I can make a 
ShotCut implementation.
